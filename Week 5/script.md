BRAD  
Now you’ve got everything she had.

AMY    
She got everything I ever wanted! Ever since we were kids, she got everything! She won the scholarship and got to follow her dreams, and I was left working two part-time jobs just to pay for school. She got to be a celebrity while I slept five hours a night and lived off beans and rice. She landed the starring role and I was offered the consolation prize of understudy. But you know what? Even after all that, I couldn’t hate her. Of course I couldn’t. And then I gave up, decided to go my own way, to find something that would make me happy, and when I found it, found one thing that I really wanted—

> _She catches herself._

AMY (CONT'D)  
—she won that competition too. 

BRAD  
I’m sorry.

AMY    
I don’t blame her. It wasn’t a competition to her. She didn’t know how I felt. 

BRAD  
No, she didn’t. _(beat)_ She loved you.

AMY    
Yeah.

BRAD  
She talked about you all the time. 

AMY    
Don’t say that.

BRAD  
Why not? She would’ve done anything for you.

AMY    
I don’t want to hear this.

BRAD  
She was so proud of you—she would tell me again and again how much she admired your ambition and drive.

AMY    
Stop it.

BRAD  
Do you think she’d be happy for you now?

AMY    
I said, stop it.

BRAD  
You’ve got everything you wanted. Full-ride scholarship, no more financial woes; hell, who do you think they’re gonna audition first for her roles, now that she’s gone? An identical twin makes for the perfect understudy.

AMY    
Why are you doing this?!

BRAD  
Because you lied!

AMY    
...what?

BRAD  
You lied. It was your fault.

AMY    
What are you saying?

BRAD  
Why do you think she wanted to leave? She was trying to stop you from doing something stupid— 

AMY    
We were all drunk.

BRAD  
You think I was so drunk I didn’t know the woman I was engaged to? And she knew you well enough to see you were going to do something stupid, even if she didn't know what. 

AMY    
She shouldn’t have been driving.

BRAD  
She shouldn’t have even been leaving! But we all were, because of you. And she wouldn’t have got behind the wheel if she were drunk.

AMY    
How would you know? You were passed out in the back seat by then.

BRAD  
I know Sarah, and I know that when we got into that car, you were the one in the driver’s seat. I remember that—

AMY  
_(overlapping)_  
How dare you? She was my sister—

BRAD  
—and I remember you crashing the car—

AMY    
—I begged her not to drive—

BRAD  
—and then when I heard you saying it was her—

AMY    
—I should’ve done something more—

BRAD  
You could’ve done nothing! And it would’ve been better! And maybe she would still be alive.

> _They both stare at each other for a moment._

BRAD (CONT’D)  
So when I heard you say it was her driving, I did nothing. I didn’t know what to do. I decided I’d give you a chance to do the right thing.

AMY    
_(coldly)_  
Which is?

BRAD  
Tell them. Tell your parents, tell everyone, that it was you, not Sarah. Preserve her memory and accept responsibility for what you did.

AMY    
You’re wrong.

BRAD  
I’m asking you to do the right thing.

AMY    
I have done the right thing. I’ve accepted that my sister made one single terrible mistake, and now she’s gone forever. You need to accept that too.

BRAD  
You’re lying.

AMY    
Prove it.

> Brad blinks in surprise.

AMY (CONT’D)  
What proof do you have? Besides your own whiskey-colored memories. You remember what you want to remember, because it’s easier. Blame me, and let her be perfect forever.

BRAD  
It’s the truth.

AMY    
It’s easier for you! But that doesn’t make it true. It just means you’ll ruin what’s left of my life to try to salvage her memory.

BRAD  
If you won’t come clean, I’ll have to tell your parents what really happened.

AMY    
Fine, do it! Go on, tell them what you think you saw. Take their other daughter away from them too.

BRAD  
So that’s it? I should just let you drag Sarah’s memory through the mud so you can get away clean? You think she deserves that?

AMY    
No! She doesn’t deserve anything, because she’s dead! She doesn’t feel, she doesn’t think, she’s got nothing left! But I’m alive, and I’ve got my whole life left. I get to wake up every day and see her in the mirror. I have to deal with the fact that every time my parents look at me, all they see is an understudy. I get to live knowing that even with her dead, I’ll never escape her shadow.

BRAD  
And you want me to keep quiet and watch you steal her life.

AMY    
Life is for living. It’s wasted on the dead.

> _A long, silent pause. Brad studies Amy and she glares back unflinchingly. He seems to come to a conclusion and looks away from Amy._

BRAD  
I’m leaving Fairview. I’m going to get my things from the apartment and I’ll be gone by Sunday.

> _(beat)_

AMY    
That’s awfully fast.

BRAD  
Yeah, well, I can’t stay.

AMY    
There’s nothing left for you here?

BRAD  
_(firmly)_  
No.

> _Another long pause. Brad continues refusing to look at Amy._

AMY    
Good luck.

BRAD  
Thanks.

> _After a beat, Brad moves to leave, but stops just before exiting. He finally looks back at Amy, his expression inscrutable._

BRAD (CONT’D)  
Amy?

AMY    
Yes?

BRAD  
_(sincerely, without any bitterness or anger, but also without any trace of warmth)_  
Have a good life.

AMY    
Yeah. You too.

> _Brad exits and Amy is left alone._
