# Week 5

### Delivered/Accomplished:

- Attended Yoga class
- First draft of a script for a play
- Started reading _Categories for the Working Mathematician_, an introduction to category theory

<!-- ### Usage Notes -->

### Skills Practiced/Learned:

- Yoga/improved physical fitness (I'm counting that as a skill, shut up)
- Creative writing
- Maths
  - Category theory

### Notes:

I had my wrist dislocated halfway through the week, so I wasn't able to do much typing or stuff with my hands. As such, I expect that this week and next will both be lighter on code. I think I might focus on some reading in the meanwhile. Category theory is interesting, but it would probably be wise to invest my time in something more applicable, like linear aglebra and analysis techniques.


### Possible Next Steps:

- Further improve D&D helper: probably on hold for now due to resting my wrist injury
- Learning about math topics, especially linear algebra
- Web scraper application
